# Personal Website | Protfolio 🐱‍👤🐱‍🏍

I have been learning react since couple of weeks. Since, this is a simple static web site you can wonder why react? why not a simple HTML, CSS, & Vanilla Javascript. This website is'nt just my new portfolio, but also a personal project to learn react and to get some hands on experience with react. So, I created this project to show case my skills in react, HTML, CSS, & Javascript.

## React Thing
    - All the components I have developed are functional components
    - Used useState() hook to change the state.
    - used Props for communication between parent and child.

Thankyou for checking out the repo. Feel free to clone the repo and build your own portfolio.
